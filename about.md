Axiom Data Science is an informatics and software development firm focused on developing scalable solutions which can be leveraged across a variety of users, clients and institutions in order to make the best tools for data management, integration, and visualization. We support a variety of federal, private, academic and non-governmental organizations managing and conducting research in the ecological, geological and ocean sciences.

###Content (about/facilities)

Axiom Data Science staff includes software architects and engineers, GIS and data analysts, web and graphic designers, scientists and data librarians. Our headquarters are located in Anchorage, Alaska, and we have two satellite offices that each maintain a High Performance Compute (HPC) cluster in Portland, Oregon and Providence, Rhode Island. Together, Axiomâ€™s HPC resources are composed of more than 1400 processing cores staged in a series of interconnected blade arrays as well as 1.4 PBs of storage distributed across clustered storage nodes. Compute nodes and storage nodes are connected over a low latency, converging network fabric (40 Gb/Sec Infiniband). GlusterFS is employed as a storage software abstraction layer that enables clients and storage servers to exploit data transfer over Remote Direct Memory Access (RDMA) protocols. This configuration enables data throughput from the storage cluster to the compute cluster to reach speeds greater than 160 Gb/Sec in high-concurrency situations necessary for large-scale scientific modeling as well as hosting, querying and visualizing large, long-term data sets. Axiom also has a dedicated multi-braided 1 Gb/Sec high speed internet connection for large file transfers between external data centers and the high-bandwidth demands of centralized web/cloud based applications.
