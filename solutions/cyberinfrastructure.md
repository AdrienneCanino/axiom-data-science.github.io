Cyberinfrastructure incorporates all of the necessary hardware and software you require to conduct your research with the highest level of accuracy and efficiency.

###Scalable frameworks

Axiom employs a scalable framework for managing a variety of data types. Our systems are built on interoperability systems and customized user interface tools to allow data to be visualized, discovered and accessed by the broader community.

###High Performance Computing

As the size and complexity of data collection and modeling efforts grow, the need for scientists to routinely access HPC resources is becoming more common. Whether you have 30 years of model results that you want to process into monthly climatologies, or you want to query a database with a few million rows of ship locations, we can help. Axiom Data Science builds and provides access to HPC compute clusters that can make these types of services available fast and over the web.
