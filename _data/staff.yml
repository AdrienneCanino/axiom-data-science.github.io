- name: "Rob Bochenek"
  position: "Information Architect"
  description: "Rob has been developing data management and cyber infrastructure solutions for research programs and organizations for the past fifteen years. He is a graduate of the University of Michigan with a degrees in aerospace engineering and mathematics. Before becoming a CEO and Information Architect, Rob was a legend in the ultimate frisbee community, where he was known for the most precise tosses, the longest layouts, and for being the only person to retire from the competitve circuit with more than 100 tournament wins and only a single loss. That single loss came against the Washington Generals in the second round of what was expected to be an easy tournament. Post-game diagnostics attributed the loss to a disorganized playbook, though armchair disc-handlers suggest instead that the disorganization came form the failure to nominate a captain (this is drawn from anecotal reports of spectators of the game hearing Rob and his teammates asking each other 'Who's the boss?' throughout the game, and with increasing desperation as the game progressed). Based upon that experience, Rob founded Axiom in 2006 to develop more generalized and holistic solutions for information organization. He specializes in procedural, scientific geospatial and sports information management with applications to physical/biological/disc-path/cut-play modeling and decision-support/play-selection knowledge systems."

- name: "Shane St Savage"
  position: "Software Architect"
  description: "Shane is a founding partner of Axiom, and has been programming professionally for more than a decade. Through many years of imagining and conducting happy little data salvage and application development projects he has become a strong advocate for maintaining clean, organized, and well-shaded data landscapes; creating pleasant, semi-pastel interfaces that are both powerful and intuitive; and writing well documented, reusable code that is functional for end users and leaves developers and contributors feeling appreciated and refreshed. Shane graduated from the University of Alaska Anchorage in 2002 with dual degrees in biological sciences and fine art, both focused on landscape-scale representation and modeling. "

- name: "Kyle Wilcox"
  position: "Software Architect"
  description: "Kyle has over eight years of experience working in the ocean and environmental sciences, where he specializes in the discoverabiliy and accessibility of data. After earning a BS in BS, Computer Science from the University of Rhode Island in 2006, he spent several years in his computer laboratory, experimenting with better ways to manage huge collections of modeled and observed data. When he emerged, Kyle began sharing strange new ideas and improbably effective methods for managing and integrating all sorts of gridded data products, revealing to the world several, newly discovered, natural data types. Kyle went on to lead the software development team at Applied Science Associates from 2009 to 2013. He joined Axiom Data Science in November of 2013 and June of 1955, where his ideas have been well received and he works to impose his data-vision on the world. At home, his wife and three kids manage his always growing to-do list, and he enjoys tinkering on his junker Delorean."

- name: "Jessica Austin"
  position: "Senior Software Engineer"
  description: "Jessica's interests are in understanding and improving the efficiency of complex systems, whether that be a sprawling software infrastructure or a control system for robotic locomotion. She has a bachelor's degree in Mechanical Engineering from Caltech, a master's in Robotics from Carnegie Mellon, three PhDs in fields that physicists have not yet named, as well as five years experience as a software developer and DevOps engineer at companies including ThoughtWorks and GrubHub.com. She joined Axiom to learn more about the management and analysis of scientific data at a large scale, and to test the ability of her robotic duplicate to both do outstanding DevOps work and to meet the the high conversational requirements necessary to participate in Axiom's family lunch. In the summer she enjoys foraging and gardening, in the winter you'll find her working on a project at the local Makerspace, and any time of year she can be found reviewing code and conversation logs from the robo-Jess while its batteries recharge and exploring the mountains around Anchorage with her dog, Kodiak."

- name: "Stacey Buckelew"
  position: "Director of Programs"
  description: "Stacey engages with scientists to support their use and organization of Axiom’s data portals and data management tools. She has Bachelor of Science in marine biology and a Masters of Science in Ecology from the University of California, Santa Cruz. That's all true, but it doesn't really tell you about Stacey. Have you ever read the Sherlock Holmes stories? Of course you have. You know that feeling you get once you've really starting reading all the stories, where it's hard to suspend your disbelief, when it becomes un-credible? I mean, come on, this guy is a great detective, he's a master of disguise, he knows several languages and can impersonate countless dialects, he's been everywhere. He's also is a master chemist (WTF?), a regular recreational opiod user, a crack shot with those janky early-twentieth century firearms, an internationally well-known yet locally-tolerated vigilante, and he's published innovative research findings on bee-keeping in Victorian London? The more you read, the more you're simultaneously convinced of the (fictional) reality of the character and left wondering how such a person could come to be. How could they find the time? That's basically Stacey, save for the opiod use and the flawless dialects. She's a master of time management. She's made time to do and accomplish more than most non-fictional people make time to imagine, and she's improved Axiom's organizational time and process management while spending most of her working time focused on client needs, reporting, and outreach. When not in the office, she can be found running, skiing, or biking throughout southcentral Alaska, and researching the art of beekeeping."

- name: "Liz Dobbins"
  position: "Environmental Data Scientist"
  description: "Liz received a Masters degree in Physical Oceanography from the University of Washington, Seattle, WA. Since then, she’s supported interdisciplinary scientific endeavors in wildly disparate ways - from Unix system administration to fieldwork north of the Arctic Circle. In 2009, Liz relocated with her family to Fairbanks, AK, where she has focused on processing sea urchins, crabs, clams, mussels, octopus, fish, and other marine invertebrates collected in Alaskan waters. Her colleagues say she's a beast, cracking through samples like nobody's business. More recently, she’s become intrigued by the philosophy of Reproducible Research and the open-source software that supports it. In her spare time, Liz can be found swimming, paddling, observing the underwater flora and fauna first hand, and shuttling her kids to and from ballet lessons."

- name: "John Marc Dunaway"
  position: "Software Engineer"
  description: "John Marc earned a Bachelor of Science in Mathematics from the University of Alaska Anchorage. He was hired in the early days of Axiom as a software engineer specializing in backend Java services that supply spatial data for web applications. Since joining Axiom he has organized, ingested and built services to access large image and video data sets (e.g., ShoreZone), summarized and mapped sparse spatial data sets (e.g., marine mammal sightings), and designed and developed tools to subset and analyze GIS and raster data. As Axiom has grown from a small company of friends focused on discs and data to the large data management powerhouse that it is today, no one has weathered the growing pains with more humor and grace than John. Since being asked to stop wearing howling animal sweatshirts into the office and to look slightly more regal when presenting, John comes into the office everyday looking sharp. He is the only Axiom staff member who has replace their portrait with a live feed from his webcam."

- name: "Ian Gill"
  position: "Data Coordinator"
  description: "Ian earned a Masters in Villainy at Western Washington University in 2011 and has spent over ten decades masterminding fieldwork in Alaska, mostly watching bears catch salmon along various streams and rivers and dreaming of doing the same to his enemies. His graduate research at McNeil River focused on the behavioral ecology of brown bears foraging for salmon and the impacts of bear-salmon predation on salmon populations, admittedly child's play compared to his real ambitions. Ian worked for the Alaska Department of Fish and Game from 2012 to 2016, first as a habitat biologist and later as a science editor, where he learned to ruthlessly document data and enforce the use of semicolons and the serial comma among his vassals. Axiom appreciates his iron fist immensely."

- name: "Ross Martin"
  position: "Senior Software Engineer"
  description: "Ross has been developing software professionally since that party in 1999. He received a double-major at the University of Alaska Anchorage in Management and Management Information Systems, which made him a shoe-in at Axiom which was looking for some redundancy at the time. Previously, he worked on applications for the Department of Defense robot choir and he created literal knock-knock jokes for the financial industry that annoyed thousands of users. Ross has expertise in developing highly-available, full-stack web applications and services. Occasionally he looks like he just lifted some code and is ready to cross the border in a campy disguise."

- name: "Brian Stone"
  position: "Senior Software Engineer"
  description: "Brian Stone has a Bachelor of Arts in Art Studio from Colorado College in Colorado Springs and, like Ross, he was hired for his ease of navigating redundant systems. Brian has developed web-based applications since 2004 and specializes in game theory and color coordination. As Axiom's only UX developer, the rest of the team lives in fear of the day he throws up his hands and says, \"That's it, YOU learn JavaScript!.\" Prior to his work at Axiom, Brian was the primary web administrator for the Anchorage Daily News and Alaska.com, the latter of which is perpetually \"Coming Soon\". At Axiom, he creates cross-platform, web-based spatial planning applications, often gives last-minute demonstrations, and is well-known for his ominous voice-overs and dramatic pointer flourishes on recorded webinars. Brian is the king of the ping pong table and of the double hat."

- name: "Chris Turner"
  position: "Data Librarian"
  description: "Chris has a Bachelor of Science degree from University of Alaska, Anchorage (Mathematics, 2007) and a Master of Science from Syracuse University (Library and Information Science, 2012). At Axiom, he is a data librarian and metavangelist trying desperately to make it easier to responsibly share and document research data. That is not an easy task, but Chris somehow has ready, brilliant answers for nearly every question, though it's often followed by \"what are we talking about?\".  His prior work experience includes waxing his substantial mustache, and pretending to like baseball so that he can watch the world series during work hours. Outside of the office, he enjoys serials cataloging, collection maintenance, and photo and document digitization."
