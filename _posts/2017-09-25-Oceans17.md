This past week Axiom was pleased to have the OCEANS17 conference at our front door in Anchorage, Alaska. Twice each year, the Marine Technology Society and the IEEE Oceanic Engineering Society sponsor OCEANS, a prestigious conference/exhibition that draws an international audience of more than 2,000 attendees. Axiom participated in the conference by hosting a half-day workshop, *Data Management in the Ocean Sciences: Technologies, Tools, and Approaches Learned From a Decade Managing Data*. The entire Axiom team was present en masse to provide a view into the new technologies weâ€™ve implemented to help agency and industry partners meet their data management challenges. From high-performance compute clusters, cloud-based data sharing in the Research Workspace, data hosting and visualizations, interoperability systems, to minting DOIs, and publishing datasets and metadata in the Research Workspace DataONE member node, we covered our end-to-end approach for stakeholders to manage data throughout its entire lifecycle. 

In addition to presenting part of our tutorial, Axiom CEO, Rob Bochenek, co-chaired sessions on "Marine GIS and Data Fusion," and "Information Management and Visualization," and presented a paper titled *Cyberinfrastructure to Support Data Management* that he co-authored with our data librarian, Chris Turner. Their paper will be accessible through the [IEEE Xplore Digital Library](http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/Xplore/home.jsp) once the conference proceedings have been published and is available <a href='/assets/files/Oceans17.Bochenek.DataMgmt.prepub.pdf'>here</a> as a pre-pub. 

If you missed out on one of the Axiom t-shirts or hoodies we gave away at our tutorial, you'll have another chance. Look for us at the [2018 AGU Ocean Sciences Meeting](https://osm.agu.org/2018/) held 11-16 February 2018, in Portland, OR (the backyard to another Axiom office!).
