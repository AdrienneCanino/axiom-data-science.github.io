We are pleased to introduce Ian Gill as the new metadata technician at Axiom Data Science. Ian joined the team August 1 to focus initially on metadata services for NPRB annual projects. Ian has over 10 years experience working with Alaska Department of Fish and Game (ADF&G) as the statewide editor for scientific and technical fisheries reports, where he coordinates reporting standards among dozens of biologists all over the state and curates a report archive that goes back almost 30 years. Additionally, Ian has spent many years working as a field biologist studying bear foraging behavior at the Anan Creek Wildlife Observatory and the McNeil River State Game Sanctuary. With his extensive science editing experience coupled with a research background, we believe Ian will make a strong addition to the Axiom-NPRB data management team. When not in the office, Ian, who is both an accomplished napper and a coffee snob, can usually be found writing haikus, hitting contested three-pointers at the buzzer, or reading Tumble Bumble to his daughter (again). Welcome to Axiom, Ian!
