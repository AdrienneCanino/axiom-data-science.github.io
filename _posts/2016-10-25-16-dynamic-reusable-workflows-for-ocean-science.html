<p>In a recent Journal of Marine Science and Engineering publication, co-authors from U.S Geological Survey, Southeast Coastal Ocean Observing Regional Association, and Axiom Data Science describe a workflow that automates the skill assessment of water temperature forecasts from multiple ocean forecast models, allowing improved forecast products to be delivered. These workflows are designed to adapt as new data enter the data system, facilitate reproducible science, provide templates from which new scientific workflows can be developed, and encourage data providers to use standardized services.
