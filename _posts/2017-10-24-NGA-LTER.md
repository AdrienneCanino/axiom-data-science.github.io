This month, Axiom participated in the kick-off meeting for the new <a href='https://lternet.edu/node/84415'>Northern Gulf of Alaska LTER site</a>. The <a href='https://lternet.edu'>Long Term Ecological Research (LTER)</a> program is an NSF-funded network of 28 sites with long and rich histories of sustained data-collection. The NGA LTER site will build upon decades of oceanographic sampling along the ,a href='http://www.sfos.uaf.edu/sewardline/'>Seward Line transect</a> and the <a href='http://www.ims.uaf.edu/gak1/'>Gulf of Alaska mooring (GAK1)</a>, while expanding the sampling routine performed at each station and introducing new several new transects. The new Northern Gulf of Alaska (NGA) site is one of three new sites selected in 2017 for LTER support, along with the <a href='https://lternet.edu/node/84413'>North East U.S. Shelf</a> and <a href='https://lternet.edu/node/84426'>Beaufort Lagoon Ecosystem</a> sites. 

Axiom's role in the NGA LTER will be as LTER site information managers. We'll be responsible for helping NGA LTER scientists understand and meet data management requirements. We'll use the Research Workspace for sharing and managing data and for writing metadata, and we'll use the integrated Jupyter notebooks for visualizing timeseries, anomalies, and modeling results.
