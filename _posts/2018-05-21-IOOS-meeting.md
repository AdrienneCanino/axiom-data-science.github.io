This yearâ€™s IOOS Data Management and Communications (DMAC) Meeting took place from May 21-23 at the Silver Spring Civic Center in Silver Spring, Maryland. The meeting was a chance for data managers from all of the different IOOS Regional Associations and other groups to get together and discuss a wide range of topics from data quality control to web analytics. Here Axiom's Rob Bochenek, Kyle Wilcox, Stacey Buckelew, and Jessica Austin presented on several topics, including the <a href="https://sensors.ioos.us/"> IOOS Environmental Sensor Map </a>, <a href="https://mbon.ioos.us/"> the MBON data portal </a>, the <a href="https://ioos.noaa.gov/project/atn/"> IOOS Animal Telemetry Network's Data Assembly Center (DAC) </a>, <a href="http://secoora.org/webcat/"> the SECOORA WebCat- Live Cameras and Historic Feeds </a>, and more! The meeting was a great opportunity to share experience and demonstrate new technologies with other data managers and helps foster the already strong IOOS-DMAC community.
