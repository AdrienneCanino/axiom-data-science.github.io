Axiom Data Science has been working with a group of scientists to share information related to harmful algal blooms in Alaska.

Under the umbrella of the Alaska Ocean Observation System, part of the national Integrated Ocean Observation System (IOOS) network, a partnership of state agencies, Alaska Native organizations and the University of Alaska has launched the Alaska Harmful Algal Bloom Network. The intent is to stitch together a statewide approach to researching, monitoring, responding to and spreading information about harmful algal blooms in the state.

Axiom has been supporting the group through the development of the AHAB portal, which displays shellfish and phytoplankton data at monitoring locations throughout Southeast and Southcentral Alaska. To access the portal click [here](http://www.aoos.org/alaska-hab-network/report/). 

The Alaska HAB network was featured in recent news articles by [NOAA](https://coastalscience.noaa.gov/news/nccos-alaska-partners-provide-harmful-algal-bloom-awareness-via-ahab-network/), the [Peninsula Clarion](http://peninsulaclarion.com/news/local/state/2018-02-05/network-seeks-bring-together-data-harmful-algal-blooms), the [Homer News](http://homernews.com/business/2018-02-08/network-seeks-bring-together-data-harmful-algal-blooms), and the [Kodiak Daily Miner](http://www.kodiakdailymirror.com/news/article_e1e06b90-0f9d-11e8-a27f-6b90afc5cf71.html).
