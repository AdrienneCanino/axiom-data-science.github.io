We’ve been busy! Last week the Research Workspace Team at Axiom Data Science replaced the Ocean Workspace with our latest technology: the Research Workspace. The [Research Workspace](https://researchworkspace.com/) offers many new features to improve data management and collaboration across all stages of scientific programs. We are excited to offer this technology to help accelerate the power of data sharing, documentation, and analysis among you and your research collaborators.

What's New
----------

* You have the power: Share projects directly with your colleagues and manage their permissions. Give research campaigns and organizations access to foster collaboration.
* Maximize your data: Join the interactive computing community to analyze your data and other curated datasets using R or Python-based Jupyter notebooks.
* Metadata made easy: Follow self-guided prompts to produce ISO 19110 and 19115-2 metadata for your projects, folders, and files. No more fiddling with XML!
* Publish your final datasets: Get your final data package archived and citable for use by the broader scientific community. [Contact us](mailto:info@researchworkspace.com) for help on establishing a data archive pathway.

Limited Access Mode
-------------------

Access to the Research Workspace is currently limited to prior members of the Ocean Workspace while we fine-tune your experience. If you're not a current member, sign up to be alerted when open access begins.

In developing this new version of the Workspace we’ve incorporated feedback acquired from our dedicated Ocean Workspace user community. The Research Workspace would not have been possible without key partners, including the Alaska Ocean Observing System (AOOS), Integrated Ocean Observing System (IOOS), North Pacific Research Board (NPRB), Exxon Valdez Oil Spill Trustee Council’s Gulf Watch Alaska and Herring Research and Monitoring programs, and the Prince William Sound Science Center. We also want to acknowledge our growing community for their usage and commitment to the Workspace over the years. Thank you for your support!

We have worked hard to offer you the Research Workspace and hope you will be pleased with the new platform.
