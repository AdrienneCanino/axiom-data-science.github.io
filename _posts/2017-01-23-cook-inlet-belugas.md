The [endangered Beluga population of Cook Inlet](https://alaskafisheries.noaa.gov/pr/ci-belugas) has been in the news this past month with the [release of a new recovery plan](https://www.adn.com/alaska-news/wildlife/2017/01/04/recovery-plan-for-endangered-belugas-focuses-on-biggest-threats-to-dwindling-population/). Axiom Data Science has been continuing work on both the [Cook Inlet Beluga Whale Ecosystem Portal](http://portal.aoos.org/?portal_id=58#), and the [Scientific Sightings Mapper](http://portal.aoos.org/?portal_id=58#module-metadata/7972057a-bc66-11e3-bca9-00219bfe5678/8a3f96a4-8f7c-11e3-b524-00219bfe5678), which compiles professional beluga observations from multiple private and public organizations in Cook Inlet. This fall Axiom added thousands of beluga sighting locations to the mapper. Some of these came from our existing partners at the National Marine Mammal Laboratory, LGL Alaska Research Associates Inc. and Joint Base Elmendorf Richardson, but we're happy to have worked with several new partners:

- Friends of the Anchorage Coastal Wildlife Refuge
- Alaska Pacific University and AECOM Port of Anchorage Modernization program
-  the Alaska Energy Authority's Susitna-Watana Hydroelectric Project

This Friday afternoon (January 27th) Axiom Data Science CEO Rob Bochenek will discuss this project, and future opportunities for collaboration on Cook Inlet Belugas, at the [Alaska Marine Science Symposium](http://amss.nprb.org/) workshop on Cook Inlet Beluga Management, Research, and Partnership Opportunities. Come find us there or [contact us](http://www.axiomdatascience.com/contact/) to work with us on this unique population of whales.
