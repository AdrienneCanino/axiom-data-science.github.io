Axiom held its fourth-annual Pajama Jammy Jam (PJJ) staff retreat and strategic planning session in Anchorage, AK from September 18th to 22nd. This week of intense planning, problem solving, and foosball serves as a chance for staff from our offices across the country to come together, get facetime, and develop our vision for the coming year.

This year's PJJ featured a stirring State of Axiom address from CEO Rob Bochenek and a corporate team-building exercise to beautify an Anchorage community landmark. There was plenty to discuss as Axiom has big plans for the coming year, including the full public launch of the [Research Workspace](https://researchworkspace.com/), updated [sensor map](http://dev.axiomdatascience.com/?portal_id=45) technology, and lots of opportunities for new data partnerships.

This year's PJJ was held concurrently with the [Oceans17](http://www.oceans17mtsieeeanchorage.org/) conference, hosted by the [Marine Technology Society](https://www.mtsociety.org/) and the [IEEE Oceanic Engineering Society](http://www.oceanicengineering.org/). Axiom's contributions to that conference will be detailed in an upcoming blog post. Stay tuned!
