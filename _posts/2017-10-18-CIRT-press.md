The Cook Inlet Response Tool is designed to help oil spill responders understand important environmental factors and resources in the area surrounding an oil spill, such as commercial fisheries, nearby marine mammals and wildlife.

The Cook Inlet Regional Citizensâ€™ Advisory Council helped build the tool with the Alaska Ocean Observing System and Axiom Data Science. Within the next year, the tool will be expanded to include data on important subsistence and personal use resources. These data are important for managers and oil spill responders to understand which areas are being used by local residents to harvest wild resources.
