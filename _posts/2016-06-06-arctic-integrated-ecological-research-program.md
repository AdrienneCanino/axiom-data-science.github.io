We’ve been awarded a contract from the <a href="http://nprb.org">NPRB</a> to provide data management support and services for the <a href="http://www.nprb.org/arctic-program">Arctic Integrated Ecosystem Research Program (IERP)</a>. The Arctic IERP is a multi-component, five year effort designed to study the northern Bering and southern Chukchi Seas to better understand the relationships between physical ocean and environmental drivers (e.g. …) and the structure and function of the biological components of the ecosystem, including human access to subsistence resources. This is a huge effort, with $7.75M in funding from the NPRB, BOEM, and the Collaborative Alaskan Arctic Studies Program (CAASP)<sup>1</sup>, and an additional $7.25M in in-kind support from other agencies. 

The specific data management needs of such a program are many, but all are directed towards the goals of making the data broadly understandable, available, and ensuring it is preserved for future reuse. Our approach is split between data management support and the enhancement of some existing technologies. Data management personnel will provide assistance in creating data management plans; provide guidance and best practices on data formatting and metadata quality; and maintain data and metadata inventories and status reports. Some of the technologies we’ll leverage include:

- the Research Workspace - a private application for organizing data, sharing it across the AIERP team, and documenting it with standards compliant metadata; 
- the AOOS data system - a robust, secure create system for ingesting heterogeneous datasets and creating intuitive, interactive map-based visualizations;
- Axiom’s HPC resources - high performance and availability compute and storage resources replicated on the east and west coasts;
