Axiom held its third-annual Pajama Jammy Jam staff retreat in Granite Point Mountain Lodge, on Resurrection Bay, outside of Seward, AK. We planned this yearly retreat as an opportunity to unwind and socialize with team members who work remotely in Rhode Island, California, Oregon, and Montana, while discussing our projects and priorities for the coming year. Despite the (almost) non-stop rain, we explored the coastline in kayaks, caught rockfish, leveled up our after-dinner party game skills, and set the agenda for the planning discussions later in the week.
