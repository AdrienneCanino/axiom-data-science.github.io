The Alaska Marine Science Symposium (AMSS) will be happening January 28- Feburary 1 in Anchorage. The AMSS is Alaskaâ€™s premier marine research conference, which has been bringing together scientists, educators, resource managers, students, and interested public for over twenty years to discuss the latest marine research being conducted in Alaskan waters. 

Axiom will be hosting several workshops focused on Jupyter Notebooks and metadata creation using the Research Workspace. Additionally, we will be available to answer questions, provide assistance, and arm you with the tools to make you fall in love with data and metadata all over again. Come check us out!
