Axiom Data Science will be holding a metadata workshop ([Metadata 411](https://www.alaskamarinescience.org/workshops/) on Friday morning, 9am - 12pm) and hosting 2 metadata office hours sessions (Wednesday at 3pm and Thursday at 10am) at the Alaska Marine Science Symposium later this month. If you've got questions about how to organize and/or document your dataset, the office hours would be a great time to drop in and talk with us about it. If you're interested in learning more about metadata in general, the Friday workshop will be a hands-on walk through of how to write high-quality metadata using the Research Workspace's built-in editor. We hope to see you there!
