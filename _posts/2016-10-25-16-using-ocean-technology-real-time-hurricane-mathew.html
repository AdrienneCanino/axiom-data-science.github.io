<p>As Matthew moved from the Bahamas to the Carolinas, ocean observing technology – such as buoys - captured waves over 20 feet and wind speed of over 50 knots along its’ path. Buoys, coastal stations, forecast models and other ocean technology transmit data – such as wind speed and wave height – in near real time to data servers and portals. Near real time data is used by weather forecasters and Emergency Response Managers to confirm what the models are predicting and report the true conditions. It helps them accurately decide the best way to respond to dangerous situations.</p>

<p>The Southeast Coastal Ocean Observing System (SECOORA) Data Portal, developed in partnership with Axiom Data Science,  allows visualization of data from multiple sources in near real-time. To view the Hurricane Matthew track as measured by wave and ocean buoys, and for the full article click <a href="http://secoora.org/Using-Ocean-Technology-to-Capture-Hurricane-Matthew-in-Real-Time">here</a>. </p>
