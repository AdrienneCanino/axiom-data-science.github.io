<p>AOOS and Axiom Data Science are partnered in two five-year monitoring grants by the Exxon Valdez Oil Spill Trustee Council to provide data management services for long-term research and monitoring in the region of the Gulf of Alaska affected by the 1989 oil spill. These long-term programs are the Herring Research and Monitoring Program and the Long Term Monitoring Program, also known as GulfWatch Alaska.</p>


<p>Axiom, AOOS, and program researchers recently attended the annual meeting held in Cordova, Alaska, which was hosted by the Prince William Sound Science Center. Key findings from the 5-year research and monitoring efforts were shared, with a focus towards ecosystem-level synthesis of scientific results. Time was also spent planning and coordinating the upcoming 5-year activities. The meeting culminated in an outreach event to spill-area community members to encourage their understanding about the state of the marine environment and injured natural resources.</p>


<p>Axiom would like to extend our gratitude to the Prince William Sound Science Center for such a fine welcome to Cordova. We look forward to our next 5 years supporting these programs!</p>
