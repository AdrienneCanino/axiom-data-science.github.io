<p>The end of 2016 marks the end of Axiom Data Science’s 10th year in business. From humble beginnings in Rob’s East Anchorage garage, we’ve grown into an agile, innovative data science company supporting environmental research efforts across North America:</p>

<ul>
<li>Staff of 19 (including Francis the Therapy Dog)</li>
<li>Posh headquarters in Anchorage, Alaska, with satellite offices in Providence, Rhode Island, and Portland, Oregon</li>
<li>A high-performance computing center with 1,400 processing cores and 1.4 petabytes of storage, configured to enable data throughput at over 160 gigabytes/sec</li>
<li>Data management partnerships with over 2 dozen organizations, including the <a href="https://ioos.noaa.gov/">Integrated Ocean Observing System</a> and 3 of its regional associations (<a href="http://www.aoos.org/">AOOS</a>, <a href="http://www.cencoos.org/">CeNCOOS</a>, and <a href="http://secoora.org/">SECOORA</a>), as well as the <a href="http://www.nprb.org/">North Pacific Research Board</a>, the <a href="http://www.evostc.state.ak.us/">Exxon Valdez Oil Spill Trustee Council</a>, and more.</li>
</ul>

<p>We’re proud of what we’ve been able to accomplish over the past decade. It’s taken a lot of unsung heroics, quick thinking, and good old-fashioned hard work, none of which would’ve been possible without the efforts our dedicated, talented staff and the support of our many data partners.</p>

<p>And we’re just getting started! Looking ahead to 2017, we have a lot on the horizon, including new partnerships, major upgrades to our data center, a suite of more sophisticated data management tools, and the eventual upgrade of our office espresso machine.</p>

<p>Many thanks to everyone who’s been a part of helping Axiom grow and evolve so far. We’re proud to support important research efforts in vital and sensitive areas such as the Gulf of Mexico, the North Pacific, and the Arctic. We’re looking forward to a great next decade and beyond!</p>
