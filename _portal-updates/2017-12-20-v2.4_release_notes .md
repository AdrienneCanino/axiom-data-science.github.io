Release Summary
The opt-in 2.4 beta version includes 4D explorer and raster enhancements for glider, cruise, and model data. A data catalog is now accessible in the 2.4 version for discovery, browsing, and visualization through the portal map. Within the catalog, only real-time sensor, glider, and model data are available for visualization using the 2.3 and 2.4 version features. Visualization of the remaining data layers will be made in the version 2.5-2.7 releases. This release also includes user interface improvements and bug fixes.

New Features
•	Explore glider, cruise, and model data layers through the data catalog
•	Virtual sensors to calculate an estimate of the quantity of interest for model data 
•	Customizable data comparison charts for real-time sensor and model data
•	Interactive, 3D visualizations of glider data with temporal and spatial parsing for glider trajectories
•	Curtain plots for depth profiling sensors (including gliders) with user-selected options for data interpolation
•	Depth filter for profiling sensors
•	Improved map palette control, including user-controlled scale manager
