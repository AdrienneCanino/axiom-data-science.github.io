#### Release Summary

The opt-in 2.4 beta version includes 4D explorer and raster enhancements for glider, cruise, and model data. A data catalog is now accessible in the 2.4 version for discovery, browsing, and visualization through the portal map. Within the catalog, only real-time sensor, glider, and model data are available for visualization using the 2.3 and 2.4 version features. Visualization of the remaining data layers will be made in the version 2.5-2.7 releases. This release also includes user interface improvements and bug fixes.


#### New Features

* Explore glider, cruise, and model data layers through the data catalog
* Virtual sensors to calculate an estimate of the quantity of interest for model data 
* Customizable data comparison charts for real-time sensor and model data
* Interactive, 3D visualizations of glider data with temporal and spatial parsing for glider trajectories
* Curtain plots for depth profiling sensors (including gliders) with user-selected options for data interpolation
* Depth filter for profiling sensors
* Improved map palette control, including user-controlled scale manager

#### Release Summary

Opt-in beta version offered as link from existing map portal. Enhancements made to real-time data layers only. Future releases will migrated other data layers, such as model data, biological data, etc in future releases. New map interface includes splash page with introductory text and featured data dashboards (e.g. tool for visualizing highlighted data scenarios).


#### New Features

* Palette control
* State saving (save filters or searched objects)
* Integrate historic sensor stations with real time
* Climatology and anomaly charts
* Station and source level metadata pages
* Data comparison between sensor data streams
* State saving of user selections
* Improved user behavior tracking & analytics
