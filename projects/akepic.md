###The Project

The Alaska Exotic Plants Information Clearinghouse (AKEPIC) is a database and mapping application showing the distribution of non-native plant species in Alaska and neighboring Canadian territories.

###Challenges

There are millions of occurrences of non-native species in Alaska, with many non-native species occurring in each area. However, data are limited to areas where sampling has occurred, and many locations have not been sampled.

###Solutions

Axiom used the AKEPIC database to generate a customized mapping application. The application shows all of the database locations to reveal sampling effort, and locations are colored by the number of occurrences. At further out zoom levels, we use hex-binning to show statistical overviews. Users can download all the data available for an area, or all the species information for all areas.

###Highlights

Visualizing on multiple types of occurrences (non-native plants present or absent)
Data download in various formats
At high zooms, individual occurrences show individual sampling transects
