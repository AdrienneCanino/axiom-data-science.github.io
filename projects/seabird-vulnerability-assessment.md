###The Project

The United States Fish and Wildlife Service contracted Axiom to a web based tool to assess Aleutian Island seabird populations distribution and guide fine-tuned and seasonally sensitive management of shipping routes and response capabilities based on risk to seabird populations.

###Challenges

The data for this project was spread across more than 1000 individual species and season specific data files, describing the approximately 100 species (est. 40 million individuals) and 200 islands in the Aleutian Islands. Uniformly formatting, integrating, and visualizing seasonal species density and risk analyses requires high volume and availability storage, innovative filtering and retrieval mechanisms, and careful display to make the data clear to the end user.

###Solutions

Axiom designed a unique backend data store for the web-portal from which data is retrieved from indexed geotiffs or a gridded netCDF version of the data depending on visualization or  statistical need or the end user. This infrastructure allows gigabytes of raster data to be quickly displayed, queried, and filtered. Tools to query and summarize data at points or within polygons provide means for resource managers to better understand and use this complex data.

###Highlights

Bird density summaries and visualization generated on the fly for user-defined areas
Fast filtering of datasets by relative rarity, time of year, and at multiple taxonomic levels
