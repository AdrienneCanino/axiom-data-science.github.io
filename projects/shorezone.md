##The Project

ShoreZone is a coastal habitat mapping and classification project. Aerial imagery is taken from a plane flying the coastline of Alaska are meant to aid researchers studying shoreline change as well as prepare emergency response professionals in the case of an oil spill.

###Challenges

ShoreZone collects georeferenced imagery over 40,000 km of shoreline. High-resolution video, images, and classifications are recorded resulting in a massive dataset with multiple types of data that are most easily understood when shown all together.

###Solutions

Using the georeferenced video, we reconstructed the flight track. We built a customized data layer that syncs the time in the video with a marker on the flight track and any high-resolution photographs that were taken nearest to the marker. As the video plays, the marker moves and images update allowing users to "fly the coast".

###Highlights

Syncing between video, imagery, and HTML flight path and marker
Map syncing, allowing the video to continuously play
Ability to overlay other coastline datasets with aerial imagery.
